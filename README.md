# Human Emotion Understanding via Transfer Learning in Human-Robot Collaborative Contexts
Research project for Montclair [(CRoSS Lab)](https://msucrosslab.weebly.com/)
## About
Human safety is particularly critical in human-robot collaborative smart manufacturing contexts. In
this project, we propose a practical and novel framework for the robot to intuitively understand
human emotions when it works with human for shared tasks. A real-time vision system is developed to
observe human mental states, such as excited, tired, and depressed, during the human-robot
collaboration process. The transfer learning algorithm is employed to teach the robot to understand
human mental states. Based on the learned knowledge, the robot is able to automatically adjust its
actions to adapt human emotions in collaborative tasks. We verified the proposed approach through a
set of realistic human-robot collaborative tasks. Experimental results and analysis suggested that our
approach effectively improved the safety for human workers in human-robot collaborative smart
manufacturing contexts. The proposed framework can also be extended to more application areas such
as daily assistance for the disabled and healthcare for senior group.
